## Purpose
The purpose of this module was to use JavaScript to add an interactive filtering interface into our HTML web page that filters the data from our data.js file and pushes it onto the webpage. 
## Results
The website provides the users with the ability to filter the imported data on the webpage. This filter was implimented by nesting a javascript file, app.js, within the html file at the end of the html. The website then takes the user input and filters the tables based on the users inputs for each associated column in the table. The pictures below will show that when the user inputs a filter with regards to the respective ID and in the right format, the webpage will filter the table so that only entries with the users specified parameters are left on the page.

## Summary

The website is basic and has room for many improvements. One thing that could be improved on is that the table does not revert back to its original form after the filters have been cleared. The only ways to revert the table is to refresh the webpage or by pressing enter on the blank filter field, and code could be added to make it even more adaptable. The data is also restrictive in the aspect that you have to see the actual data to to see which what you can actually filter by. One thing that could be done to make it even more user friendly is to have a filter in the form of dropdown menus that will tell you what you can filter by by data that is already present in the table.
